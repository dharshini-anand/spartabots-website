 - We introduced the preseason competition!!
  - Teams must create a mechanism, predominantly out of wood, that shoots the Steamworks' wiffle balls into the three levels of the cargo side rocket from Deep Space. 
 - Build teams were created and build leads got together with their teams and started working on ideas for the competition
 - The competition is due in December at the Banquet
