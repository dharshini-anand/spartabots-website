- Software started struggling again with vision alignment
 - There are weird problems with pneumatics but we think we located the problems
 - FTC worked on the clamp mech and was pretty overwhelmed with members. They're going to focus on more prototyping and organization
 - The CNC is being bad as well and we're running into a lot of problems with getting it to work with school computers
 - And we had a pretty great turn out :)
