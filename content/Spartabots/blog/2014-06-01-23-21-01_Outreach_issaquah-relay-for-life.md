<!--t Issaquah Relay for Life t-->

By Kevin Chen

The goal of Spartabots is to be more than just a school club. Our ultimate goal is to make a lasting impact to our community, and that requires extensive outreach. On May 31 and June 1, the Spartabots participated in a cancer awareness fundraiser called Relay for Life, hosted by American Cancer Society. During these two thrilling days, hundreds of participants lined the Issaquah High School track field, united together by their determination to find a cure to cancer. Too many people have been affected by cancer, and we must fight back! 

Thanks to all of our supporters and our efforts, our team has raised over $1,600, going beyond our original goal of $1,400. Thanks for supporting us in relaying against cancer!
