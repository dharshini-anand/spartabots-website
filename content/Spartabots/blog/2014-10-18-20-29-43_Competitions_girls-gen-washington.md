<!--t Girls Gen - Washington t-->

On October 18th, 2014, our team, 2976 Spartabots, placed first at the Washington Girls Gen robotics competition. In our alliance were teams 1318 Issaquah Robotic Society and 1983 Skunk Works Robotics.

The team won some of its qualification matchs and lost several. At the beginning we unfortunately had some software problems with the robot because we accidently changed some hardware and software for the worse after the regional competition ended several months ago. But we fixed all the problems we had before the elimination matches started.

Our team and team 1983 were picked by team 1318 and we formed a strong alliance. Our alliance went undefeated in both the semi-finals and finals in best two out of three matches. We won the competition and took home a trophy.
