<!--t About Us: Who We Are t-->

We are an FRC team participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition, a worldwide event that tests the ability of high school students to design, build, test, and implement a robot to fulfill a specific task. Our veteran students are supported by mentors from  Boeing, Cascade Engineering, and Expedia, and work throughout the year to prepare for the competition, train new members, and promote robotics throughout the local community. Our club, Team 2976, operates as a club at Skyline High School.

Located in Sammamish, Washington, Skyline High School serves students in grades 9 through 12, with approximately 2,400 students. The school is noted for its high level of academic achievements, large variety of student clubs, and successful sports programs.
