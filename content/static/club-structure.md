<!--t Club Structure t-->

## Overview
Our club does a lot of things beyond building the robot, from business to finance to spirit and outreach. To help our team accomplish all these different things, our club is split into several different subteams.

 - Build and Design
 - Finance, Fundraising and Grants
 - Programming
 - Spirit and Outreach

Each team lead is also a member of the club executive board, along with the president and vice president. The build and programming teams have sub-leads that manage the different teams and report to the overall lead. The club executive board is collectively responsible for helping decide the overall direction of the club with the guidance of mentors and advisors, and managing logistics and communications.

Each student in our club can join as many subteams as they want, based on their own interests.
