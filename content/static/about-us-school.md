Skyline High School is a four-year public secondary school located in Sammamish, Washington, belonging to the Issaquah School District. Our school proudly wields the Spartan as its mascot, hence the name “Spartabots”. 
Our high school is marked by academic excellence, a wide variety of student clubs, and several successful sports programs. As students at Skyline, we strive to maintain a high level of achievement while learning from our experiences in order to become active citizens of society. 

Skyline offers the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program to all juniors and seniors, as well as selected sophomores and freshmen. Nearly a third of our annual student body decides to participate in this rigorous academic program.
Skyline is recognized by U.S. News as one of the best high schools in Washington, and has received a silver medal from U.S. News. Of the over 400 schools in Washington, our school is ranked 29th.

As Spartabots, we seek to represent our school with pride in robotics competitions and carry our tradition of scholarship and academic excellence through our progress in the prominent discipline of robotics.
Go Spartans!
