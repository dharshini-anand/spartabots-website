<!--t About Us: What we do t-->

Our team primarily participates in the FIRST Robotics Competition in which we have competed for the past four years. Every year, the competition demands a completely new robot design and purpose; in previous years, we have built robots that play soccer, basketball, and even place geometric inner tubes on poles eight feet high.

Our club requires a wide variety of skills, assets, and experience ranging from business skills such as grant applications to the technical aspects of building a 120 pound, basketball-playing robot. In order to manage all these responsibilities, our team is divided into into four sub teams:

 - Engineering
 - Programming
 - Finances and Fundraising
 - Outreach

Not only does the team build robots, but it also emphasizes the importance of community outreach through its involvement in many local community events.
