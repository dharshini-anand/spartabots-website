<!--t About Us: Website t-->

Spartabots.org is coded in PHP and uses a heavily modified version of [HTMLy][htmly-website].

The website was reprogrammed and redesigned in the summer of 2014 by Matthew Lee, the lead programmer at that time. Since October 2013, the website has received about 2,350 unique visitors and 60,000 page views.

Our website is hosted by [NearlyFreeSpeech][nfs-website] and uses CloudFlare. We have SSL enabled between the client and CloudFlare and between CloudFlare and the web server.

We also have a separate wiki ([wiki.spartabots.org][spartabots-wiki]) that is publically editable through its [GitHub repository][spartabots-wiki-github].

This website is currently managed by the webmaster, Dharshini, for the 2021-2022 school year.
