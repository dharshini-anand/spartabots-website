This was our first official meeting. There was quite a turn up as attendance logged in over 80 people. The group was split up into 5 separate teams for this years preseason in club preseason competition.

Each team will be building a shooter for the next couple of months.
This shooter will need to accurately hit a target that will be 10 ft away.
