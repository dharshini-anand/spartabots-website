Hey guys,

Thank you so much for coming out on Tuesday to the first meeting, we hope you enjoyed it! Meetings will continue to be on Tuesday after school, due to popular feedback. Next week, we'll be learning how to use a couple of tools and equipment that we use regularly in the club, so please do your best to attend as these are basic skills!

See you guys next week on the 29th in Portable 8!
