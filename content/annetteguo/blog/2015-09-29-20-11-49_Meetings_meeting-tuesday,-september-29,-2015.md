<!--t Meeting: Tuesday, September 29, 2015 t-->

Hey Team,

Thanks for coming out today! We hope you got a good basic overview of some of the things you'll be needing to do in the club - of course, we'll be working on application of these skills as well in order to help you learn. Next week, we'll be doing three more rotations. Please bring in your forms as soon possible! [Find Forms here.][1]
