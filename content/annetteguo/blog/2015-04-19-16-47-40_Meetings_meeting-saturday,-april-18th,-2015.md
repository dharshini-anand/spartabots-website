<!--t Meeting: Saturday, April 18th, 2015 t-->

This week, we continued organization of the build room. We have bought more boxes to store things in, and began additional labeling of where everything is. We have three main categories so far: P (Parts), T (Tools), E (Electronics), and Pneumatics. We also started making small kits for small table groups - our first box, a red one, is called "Team Tesla." 2-3 more kits will be built, and each contains the essentials while building.

Work was continued on the wood prototype for the mini competition. Thanks to IT guy, we were able to obtain 2 desktops for the build room also, now sitting on our software desks. We will likely install our programs in the upcoming weeks. We also continued filling out Purchase Order forms for the last buys of the year, and finished creating and signing Thank You letters for the donors of our fundraiser. Mr. Wilson is also compiling a list of items to be purchased from Grainger. Lastly, we did some repairs on the yoga ball robot.

Thank you for your hard work!
