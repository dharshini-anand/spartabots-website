<!--t Meeting: Saturday, April 11th, 2015 t-->

This week, we inventoried a lot of the materials in the build room and began reorganizing. We will continue to do this over the next few meetings. The part inventory is nearly complete, although there are a couple more items we need to purchase.

The software team has tested and removed non-functioning motor controllers. Additionally, the team's code was moved to Github, as Google Code is shutting down. They also found cRIO code, and plan to port it to a mini bot board next week.

The build team is building a wooden frame for the next mini bot competition, completing the front, rear, and 4 wheel supports. Next week, they will begin building the transmissions and electronics boards.

Also, we have started text alerts for meetings and announcements! Sign up using the following codes:
